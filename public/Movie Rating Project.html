<h2>My favorite movies to watch with my mom</h2>

<li><h3>Grease</h3></li>
<p>I grew up watching this movie. I loved all of the singing and dancing in it. This movie is probably why I like musicals so much as an adult. I still remember singing my heart out to the song Hopelessly Devoted to You at six years old. There are defininitely some things about it that are a bit cringe now, but it's still a really fun movie.</p>
<li><h3>A Walk to Remember</h3></li>
<p></p>This is one of the few pure romance movies that I like. Seeing Jamie and Landon get together is really sweet. The song Only Hope is my jam. The endinhg is sad, but there's defininitely a lot of humor throughout the movie. Award for best silent acting defininitely goes to Jamie's dad. His facial expressions said it all!
<li><h3>The Princess Diaries</h3></li>
<p>This movie is a classic! I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie. It's so funny. The soundtrack is extremely early 2000s in the best way possible. I quote this movie all the time. All of the characters in it are great. A lot of people hate on Lily. I understand, but let's remember that she's a teenager and she grows by the end of the movie and is a very supportive best friend in the sequel. I'm tempted to write about the sequal as well because I love it just as much as I love the first one. I'm hoping that we get a third one while our queen Julie Andrews is still among us.</p>
<li><h3>Ever After</h3></li>
<p>This is hands down, the best Cinderella movie of all time, and no once can convince me otherwise. The characters are so good, beacuse they're so real. Some you really love, some you hate. It has one of best "Cinderella" "Prince Charming" romances because you see them actually get to know each other as people. There are moments of triumph followed by despair. And she saves herself before getting married to the prince. Not to mention what happens to the stepmother is hilariously satisfying.  </p>
